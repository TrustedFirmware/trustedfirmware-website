  **A C library implementing cryptographic primitives, X.509 certificate manipulation and the SSL/TLS and DTLS protocols. Its small code footprint makes it suitable for embedded systems. It has many users, including TF-A, TF-M and OP-TEE.**

  The Projects page provides access to all facilities hosted including source code, documentation, GitHub review for submitting changes and a wiki.

  Contribution guidelines can be found in the documentation.

  Please subscribe to the project email list to to participate in development discussions.

  A bi-weekly [Technical Forum call](/meetings/tf-m-technical-forum/) is held to discuss technical subjects.
