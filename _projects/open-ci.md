  The Trusted Firmware **Open CI** (Continuous Integration) is a cloud-based CI infrastructure that leverages multiple components including Gerrit, Jenkins and [LAVA](https://lavasoftware.org/) to create a comprehensive end-to-end integration and test infrastructure.  It is currently leveraged by TF-M, TF-A, and Hafnium, with potentially other TrustedFirmware supported projects in the future. Open CI supports static analysis tools to increase code quality. Itâ€™s also the mechanism to approve merge requests (thru maintainer approvals) as well the ability to create source code release tags. Finally, with the back end of Open CI connected to a physical Open CI hardware lab that leverages LAVA, it validates that code changes made into the source tree actually run on [multiple hardware platforms that are currently available in the lab.](https://tf.validation.linaro.org/scheduler/device_types) Arm [Fixed Virtual Platform (FVP)](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/simulation-models/fixed-virtual-platforms) software emulators are also made available and leveraged by the TrustedFirmware development community.

  Contribution guidelines can be found in the documentation.
