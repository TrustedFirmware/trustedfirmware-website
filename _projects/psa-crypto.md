  **The PSA Cryptographic API (Crypto API) is an important PSA component that provides an interface to cryptographic operations on resource-constrained devices. The interface is user-friendly, while still providing access to the low-level primitives used in modern cryptography. It does not require that the user has access to the key material. Instead, it uses opaque key identifiers.

  This document is part of the PSA family of specifications. It defines an interface for cryptographic services, including cryptography primitives and a key storage functionality.**
