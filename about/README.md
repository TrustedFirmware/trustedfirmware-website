### Why choose Trusted Firmware?

Arm Trusted Firmware provides a reference implementation of secure world software for [Armv8-A and Armv8-M](https://developer.arm.com/products/architecture). It provides SoC developers and OEMs with a reference trusted code base complying with the relevant Arm specifications. The code on this website is the preferred implementation of Arm specifications, allowing quick and easy porting to modern chips and platforms. This forms the foundations of a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) on application processors, or the Secure Processing Environment (SPE) of microcontrollers.

  

#### Availability of Trusted Firmware

**Support for Armv8-A / Trusted Firmware-A (TF-A)**

*   Support for Arm Cortex-A processors is well established and currently available as open source on GitHub. Functionality focuses on trusted boot and a small trusted runtime (EL3 code). With the launch of www.trustedfirmware.org we will move the open source code to this site

**Support for Armv8-M / Trusted Firmware-M (TF-M) and relationship with Arm’s Platform Security Architecture (PSA)**

*   PSA provides a common security foundation for the whole IoT ecosystem. It includes many elements, including architecture specifications and threat models. An important part of PSA is open source firmware. This is available in the form of Trusted Firmware-M for Arm Cortex-M23 and Arm Cortex-M33 processors, which use Arm TrustZone technology.
*   The Trusted Firmware-M project is due to be released in March 2018 with a roadmap to incorporate PSA firmware framework features and security APIs.
*   For more information on PSA visit the [PSA Resources page](https://www.arm.com/psa-resources)

**If you want to get involved, join the notification mailing list or contact board@TrustedFirmware.org for more information.**  
  

#### Arm’s Trusted Firmware is adopting open governance

*   Arm is transferring the Trusted Firmware project to be managed as an open project by Linaro
*   Membership of the Trusted Firmware project is open to all
*   Governance is overseen by a board of member representatives
*   Details of the Governance are in the [Project Charter](/docs/Trusted_Firmware_Charter_v_2019-01-21.pdf)
*   Stakeholders in Trusted Firmware are encouraged to join
