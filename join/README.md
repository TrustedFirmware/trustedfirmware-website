# About Membership And How To Join
Companies and other organisations who deploy or use Trusted Firmware, or who participate in the firmware and security ecosystem are warmly invited to join the Trusted Firmware Project. Membership of the Trusted Firmware project is open to all and governance is overseen by a board of Member representatives. 

Companies joining the project at the Platinum level can vote and have a seat at Board meetings. Companies joining as General members may attend general meetings and have joint representation at Board meetings. The Community class of membership is open to universitities and other similar not-for-profit organisations.

To join, the company needs to sign and return a copy of the Membership Agreement and pay an annual fee which depends on the class of membership.
